# Study Tracker

A full-stack web application designed to help students track their study hours, analyze their performance, and predict future grades. Built with a **Java Spring Boot** backend and a **React.js** frontend, stored in **MongoDB**.

[App Version](https://github.com/chrislleung/Logit-Study-Tracker) 

## Features

### ⏱️ Study Tracking
* **Real-time Timer:** Stopwatch to track live study sessions for specific classes.
* **Session History:** Detailed logs of start times, end times, and durations.
* **Subject Totals:** At-a-glance view of total hours dedicated to each subject.

### Analytics Dashboard
* **Data Visualization:** Interactive graphs built with Recharts.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Scatter charts visualizing the relationship between **Time Studied** and **Grades Achieved**.
* **Efficiency Metrics:** Bar charts displaying "Points per Hour" to help identify which subjects you are most efficient in.
* **KPIs:** Key Performance Indicators like Average Efficiency.

### Predictive Grade Calculator
* **Goal Setting:** Enter a target grade (e.g., 90%) to calculate exactly what score you need on remaining exams.
* **Time Prediction Engine:** Uses linear regression on your past data to predict **how many hours** you need to study to achieve your target score.
* **Custom Scenarios:** Add hypothetical grades to see how they impact your overall average (Normalized and Absolute).
* **Dynamic Configuration:** Create custom assignment types (e.g., Labs, Quizzes, Projects) and assign specific weights.

### Class & Semester Management
* **Semester Tabs:** Organize classes by semester with Archive/Unarchive functionality.
* **Customizable Classes:** Add/Delete subjects and configure unique grading scales for each.
* **Assignment Sync:** Assignments added in the Calculator automatically sync to your Tracker.
